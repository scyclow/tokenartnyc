      <h3>Copied and adapted from the <a href="https://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html" target="_blank">JSConf Code of Conduct</a></h3>

      <section>
        <p>All participants, sponsors, organizers, and volunteers at the Token Art NYC event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
        <p>Token Art NYC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or artistic choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for event. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organisers.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
        <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

        <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. </p>

        <p>Organizers will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

        <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.</p>
