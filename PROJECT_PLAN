PROJECT PLAN

Space
  - This is the biggest piece of the puzzle, and will ultimately determine the capacity of the conference, and a large part of the finances and the structure.
  - We're aiming for a capacity of ~500 people +/- 100
  - Layout: Programming will be single track, so we need at least one room large enough to seat everyone. Additionally, we'd like ample space for expos, art installation, and schmoozing
  - Depending on the layout of the space, we think 7500 - 10000 sqft makes sense
  - Ideally Union square, Washington Square Park, Chealsea, SoHo area -- accessible in manhattan and near either greenary or water. Also open to accessible areas of brooklyn (specifically williamsburg and dumbo)
  - as long as the space has sufficient ammenities, we're flexible on the ambiance. We'd prefer something on the emptier side that we can mold (large sound studios, empty office/retail space) or something designed specifically for a conference environment. But we're also open to music venues and non traditional venues
  - rent the space for about a week, which would cover the main three days of the conference, setup + teardown time, + buffer. maybe that monday can be a checkin day + allow attendees to use the space for schmoozing


Main Programming
  - Focusing on the blockchain-based "fine art" scene
    - topics including generative art, photography, conceptual art, ai art, where NFTs fit into the broader art world and narrative, community building/technical/legal/etc talks related to artists and blockchain art making, collecting, etc.
  - single speaker track
  - mix of longer/medium/lightning talks, panels, unconferencing
  - stretch goal: incorporate a heavy online viewing component -- record/stream all of the talks, facilitate discord discussion
    - We'd like to find someone who knows what they're doing to really own this whole process
  - Example schedule
    - 10-11: opening keynote
    - 11-11:30: generative art talk
    - 11:30-12:30: generative art panel
    - 12:30-1:30: lunch
    - 1:30 - 2:30: lightning talks
    - 2:30-3: ai + gen art talk
    - 3-4: ai panel
    - 4-5:30: unconferencing
    - 5:30 - 6:30: beer-o-clock
  - dream speaker list
  - other ideas: music, some outdoor activities, block off some time where anyone can get up and talk for 2 minutes

Expo/schmoozing area, sponsorship opportunities
  - a lot of the specifics will depend on what the space allows
  - schmoozing space is very important, so we'll provide ample room for chatting/lounging/relaxing
  - sponsors can set up shop and give away free (aesthetically pleasing) stuff
  - We want to be fairly selective with this, as it's part of the overall experience. so, this won't be blatent shilling. We're thinking that "booths"/areas will be more along the lines of art installations, live minting experiences, lounges
  - sponsorship on snacks/drinks
  - sponsorship on lunch
  - sponsorship on beer-o-clock
  - sponsors name goes on badge, banner, website
  - potential sponsor list

Audio/Visual & showrunning
  - if the venue doesn't provide it, we'll need to find someone experienced to own a lot of the logisitcal pieces:
    - event stage
    - projector
    - mics/audio
    - audience seating
    - streaming?

Admissions
  - attendees check in on day 1 and receive a badge, which lets them into the rest of the conference
  - on check in, attendees must take rapid covid test
  - whoever is on admission duties will need to be trained on whatever ticketing system we go with
  - Security/bouncers: Needs more research. maybe we can use the guys that BM use

Volunteers
  - We should probably put out a volunteer form, and pick out a handful of people we know and trust to give free tickets to and help out with a lot of the manual labor

Ticketing
  - Tickets represented as NFTs
  - Put awesome generative art on tickets, which would give people an amazing, unique ticket stub
  - release tickets in three waves:
    - priority: we'd hand select addresses of people we actively want to attend the conference, and whitelist their addresses for early (maybe discounted) ticket purchases.
    - normal: we'd then make the majority of remaining tickets available to those who hold preselected NFT collections.
    - wild card: a portion of tickets would be sold to the general public. This could a) potentially bring in more revenue from selling tickets at whatever "marketprice is", and b) add a little bit of a wild card vibe to the attendee list
    - hold back some tickets for buffer/giveaways/etc

  - To reduce ticket scalping, normal and priority tickets could be refundable, but non transferrable until after the conference (or with approval). Maybe we allow the token holder to remove all pre-conference transfer restrictions by paying a fee. wild card tickets might not have any restrictions
  - We'd look to partner with someone (maybe FWB) to handle the ticketing/admissions infrasturcture.
  - I think the basic workflow would be that you get an NFT, and then you use the NFT to register online (provide name/contact info/etc), and this would email them a qr code -- when the qr code is scanned, it makes sure that the token is in the same wallet.
    - we'd obviously have to overcommunicate the fact that you need to use the NFT to register before you show up

  - ticket holders could vote on speaker, get private discord channel acess
  - if we end up with a non trivial surplus, we can either refund ticket holders some amount and/or donate to charity


Finances/Legal
  - Look to raise around $500k
    - sell tickets for ~$750 each (nft.nyc is $600, and hopefully the NFTness of the tickets would at least add another $150) for a rough total of $375k
    - maybe use the publicity machine we're creating to promote special 1/1 NFTs that we auction off
    - raise the rest of the money through sponsorship
  - incorporate as Token Art LLC in delaware
  - set up multisig wallet for ticketing


Web presence
  - website that
    - is aestheticall pleasing (ex s4a day)
    - allows users to purchase tickets/take ticket actions
    - PROMINENTLY DISPLAYS SPEAKERS + SCHEDULE
    - clearly denotes time/location + google map

  - would be nice to have someone own social media (twitter, discord moderation)
  - discord channels for:
    - general public/faqs/travel logistics
    - ? viewing streams ?
    - attendee lounge
    - speakers
    - organizers
    - volunteers
    - nft nyc week events


Branding
  - might need to allocate design resources to some of the overall branding

Code of conduct
  - bang bang con

Merch
  - face masks
  - t shirts
  - temporary tattoos
  - hats
  - prints
